# AMR-Temporal-Generalization-Model
A novel ML model solving major limitations in Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) prediction. Achieves Temporal Generalization (Recall: ~0.85) using sequence-level features (K-mers/SNPs) &amp; implements a Contextual Cross-Species framework for unified pan-genomic prediction. Fully reproducible code and models included.
